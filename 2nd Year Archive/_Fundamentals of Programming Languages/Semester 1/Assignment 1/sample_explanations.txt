The first program reads in a number, multiplies it by an approximate value of pi and prints the result.

The second program reads in the user's name and then checks it against some strings using if/else if/else statements.
Depending on what their name is, the program reacts differently. If it doesn't recognise their name, it prints "Who are you then".

The third program is a very simple one that demonstrates a basic while loop which never terminates.

The fourth and final program has some constant variables set storing the programmer's height in their chosen unit of measurement.
It performs some maths to find a multiplier to greatly increase this number... then proceeds to lie about the programmer's height.
