		<stanza>
			The Curfew tolls the knell of a parting day,
			The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
			The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
			And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
		</stanza>
		<stanza>
			Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
			And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
			Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
			And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;
		</stanza>
		<stanza>
			Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r
			The moping owl does to the moon complain
			Of such as, wand'ring near her secret bow'r,
			Molest her ancient solitary reign.
		</stanza>
