# Usage Instructions

- Once the deliverable is hosted and you have accessed the index.html landing page, use the file picker to choose a file from the source code's `media` folder.
- After picking media, you will be asked to select the four corners of the table. Follow the prompts on the page.
- When the four corners have been selected, you will be redirected to either `/html/analyseFrame.html` or `/html/analyseVideo.html` depending on the type of source media.
    - On the `/html/analyseFrame.html` page, click the button labelled `Analyse`.
    - On the `/html/analyseVideo.html` page, the video will play and begin being analysed automatically. You may play or pause playback by left clicking on either of the large canvases. You may render a large version of one of the miniature canvases by left clicking on them. Left click on the large preview to dismiss it and resume playing the video.
